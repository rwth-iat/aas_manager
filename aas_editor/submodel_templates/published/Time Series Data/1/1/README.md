# Time Series Data (Version 1.1) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

In Industrie 4.0, the ubiquity of data sources and sensors and low costs of storage has resulted in increasing amounts of time series data being captured â€“ not only during the operational phase of an asset. 
A time series is a series of data points in time order over a period of time. Time Series can represent raw data, but can also represent main characteristics, textual descriptions or events in a concise way. This Submodel template aims at an interoperable description of time series data in industrial automation for the complete asset lifecycle. The focus of this Submodel template is on the semantic information of time series data. The Submodel claims to integrate time series data within the AAS itself, but also from external data sources. Figure 1 shows the use cases, such as sensor data from real and virtual sensors, and their technical storage options inside or outside the AAS that were taken into account in the creation of this specification.
