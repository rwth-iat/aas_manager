# Workstation Worker Matching  Data (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

The focus of the Submodel “Workstation Worker Matching Planning” is on the employee scheduling and 
operational deployment of employees who carry out manual activities in production. The activities performed 
can include, for example, the processing of products, their assembly, the operation of machines and 
systems, as well as their loading and set-up, transportation, quality inspections, maintenance, servicing and 
much more. With the high level of automation and increasing digitalization and autonomation of production
the requirements for the planning and management of employees are changing. In future, employees will 
have to be deployed in a more situational and targeted manner according to their qualifications and skills. 
The fixed assignment of an employee to a workstation for an entire shift, in which the employee covers all 
the skills potentially required at the workstation, will no longer be the norm. 
In an Industry 4.0 production environment, different requirements are placed on employee scheduling than in 
a traditional production system, in which employees are manually assigned, usually by the group leader. In 
Industry 4.0 production, employees and the (autonomous) automation system will have to work together 
synergistically and employees with the appropriate qualifications or skills will have to be scheduled and 
managed according to the situation. When qualified personnel resources are scarce, the optimal allocation of 
qualifications and skills is particularly important. 
The current approach of employee scheduling (shift planning) and operative employee deployment by the 
group leader will reach its limits in future Industry 4.0 production. The classic qualification matrix for planning 
the necessary qualifications and skills will also no longer be sufficient. The manual creation and maintenance 
of the matrix will get at its limits and is not interoperable.
The "Workstation Worker Matching Data" Submodel is used to map the general-, ad hoc- and order dependent demand of a workstation for qualifications and skills. In addition, further information will be 
provided by the Submodel that are relevant for operative worker deployment and employee scheduling.
The demand for human qualifications and skills at a workstation is a result of the assignment of tasks (steps 
of a workplan) to a workstation. This Submodel Template assumes that there is a tool existing that is 
determining the demand for qualification and skills from the production plan and workplan and is writing the 
aggregated result into the AAS.
