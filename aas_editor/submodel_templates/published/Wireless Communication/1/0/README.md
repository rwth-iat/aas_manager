# Wireless Communication (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel is intended to address aspects of wireless communication. The structure of this Submodel is expressed through diagrams and UML tables, clarifying its constituent elements. In addition, potential assets and usage scenarios that can benefit from the adoption of this Submodel are identified. The main objective of this Submodel is to integrate wireless industrial communication in the context of the Industry 4.0 (I4.0) framework. The approach is based on the design of a Submodel that encompasses the parameters associated with an asset with wireless communication characteristics. Such a Submodel model is configured to create a fundamental set of Submodel elements that digitally represent relevant information about the different parts that make up a wireless communication system. This Submodel incorporates parameters relevant to various wireless communication technologies and assets. The underlying idea is that the Submodel has a generic character, allowing its application to different technologies and different types of assets. Therefore, some Submodel parameters may be more or less relevant depending on the technology and asset that will be modelled. In order to make the Submodel more specific, the user has the possibility to expand it by adding additional parameters at the time of AAS implementation. Other Submodels targeting specific communication technologies can be standardized later based on this Submodel. The Submodel focuses on layers 1 and 2 of the ISO-OSI model. The description of aspects from layer 3 upwards are not considered in this document and should be described for other submodels, as they do not depend on the type of technology, be it wireless or wired.
