# Provision of 3D Models (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

The general Scope of the specification IDTA SMT 020026 “Provision of 3D Models” with the Submodel 
“Models3D” aims to provide enough meta data to find the right file, to integrate the file in the right way and to 
do plausibility checks. The file can be either provided within the Submodel itself or, as recommended, with a 
link to an online file source. This Submodel should complement the existing 3D model file formats and is not 
meant to replace or redefine them. Nevertheless, meta data that is seen as relevant during the exchange 
(provision, search, integration) of 3D models but is not harmonized across the various 3D formats will be in 
the scope of this Submodel. Based on the experience of different stakeholders of the working group
“Provision of 3D Models”, for various reasons, there is still the demand for different 3D file formats, be it 
based on standards like ISO 10303 or proprietary software formats. The scope is based on the implemented 
use cases and might be extended in future versions of the AAS Submodel Template “Provision of 3D 
Models”. The [SM] “Models 3D” is suitable for Asset Administration Shells (AAS) of the kind type and 
instance.
In short: the scope of the SubmodelTemplate IDTA 020026 “Provision of 3D Models” with the Submodel 
“Models3D” is the provision of 3D Models by complementing and not redefining the existing 3D Model
formats themselves.
