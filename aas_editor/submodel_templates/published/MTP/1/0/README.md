# Inclusion of Module Type Package (MTP) Data into Asset Administration Shell (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.


## Scope of the Submodel 

Within the modular production, module instances are called Process Equipment Assembly (PEA). Module Type Package (MTP) is the integration technology for production modules within the modular production. MTP defines the communication interface towards the PEA and the representation of these interfaces within an MTP file. Per definition this file exclusively contains type-specific module information.
The Submodels defined in this document describe the integration of PEA (instance) and MTP (type) information into an AAS. The models do not intend to cover asset aspects addressed by further Submodel definitions like technical data or digital nameplate. Therefore, introduced models should be used along with mentioned ones to complete the AAS of the respective asset.
