# Sizing of Power Drive Trains 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

The Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of information, especially information for sizing 
electrical drive systems in industrial automation. For this purpose, the essential components drive, motor, 
gearbox, transformation as well as their additional components are described and the parameters necessary 
for the calculation are considered. Mechanical and electrical aspects are considered in the drive design. The 
Submodel specification addresses machine and plant manufacturers, manufacturers of drive compontents 
and developers of sizing tools that exchange information for the use case of drive design. The objective of 
the drive design is to select suitable components based on movement patterns and system requirements.
