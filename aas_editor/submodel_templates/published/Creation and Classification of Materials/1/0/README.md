# Creation and Classification of Materials (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

The Submodel "Creation and classification of materials in an ERP, PDM/PLM and PIM system" has been 
designed to provide a standardized interface for the creation and classification of materials across various 
system environments. Its aim is to ensure a consistent and efficient process for the creation and 
classification of material data within Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Product Information Management 
(PIM), and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) / Product Data Management (PDM) systems. A Material 
Master must exist as an object so that Classifications to this Material can be assigned correspondingly.

#### One-time Definition of Characteristics: 
This Submodel allows users to define and configure relevant  material data characteristics once. These characteristics are derived from existing Submodels and 
consolidated into a unified mapping, serving as the foundation for material creation across different systems.

#### Integrated Linking:
Upon the retrieval of an Asset Administration Shell, the " Creation and classification of 
materials in an ERP, PDM/PLM system" Submodel is directly linked to facilitate seamless integration and 
creation of material data. This process supports the standardized collection and processing of material 
information across system boundaries.

#### Import-capable Software Support: 
The implementation of this Submodel requires an import-capable 
software solution that serves as the base for processing the " Creation and classification of materials in an 
ERP, PDM/PLM system " Submodel and any additionally added Submodels. This software must be capable 
of importing, processing, and linking the defined characteristics to the Asset Administration Shell.

#### Data Return and Reuse: 
After successful material creation, generated data such as material numbers are 
returned to the Asset Administration Shell. These details can be used for creation in additional systems or 
stored for archival purposes.

This Submodel aims to enhance efficiency and consistency in material creation and classification by offering 
a standardized method for data management across ERP, PIM, and PDM/PLM systems. By streamlining the 
material creation process, the Submodel supports enterprises in optimizing their material data management 
and promotes interoperability among various systems and platforms
