## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template aims at interoperable provision of contact information in regard to the asset of the respective Asset Administration Shell. Central element is the provision of properties, ideally interoperable by the means of dictionaries such as ECLASS and IEC CDD (Common Data Dictionary).
The purpose of this document is to make selected specifications of Submodels in such manner that information about assets can be exchanged in a meaningful way between partners in a value creation network. It targets equipment for process industry and factory automation by defining standardized meta data.
The intended use-case is the provision of a standardized property structure for contact information, which can effectively accelerate the preperation for asset maintenance.
This concept can serve as a basis for standardizing the respective Submodel. The conception is based on studies of common practices at enterprises.
Beside standardized Submodel this template also introduces standardized SubmodelElementCollections (SMC) in order to improve the interoperability while modelling aspects of contact information within other Submodels.
