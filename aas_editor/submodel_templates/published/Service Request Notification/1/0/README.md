# Service Request Notification (Version 1.0) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template aims to standardize the description of a Service Request Notification that can be used to create a Service Request Notification for industrial assets, or the asset creates it via his Asset Administration Shell (AAS). These industrial assets, such as production lines, modules, infrastructure elements, and subsystems, are provided by value chain partners such as suppliers, equipment manufacturers, and system integrators. They are utilized in specific applications by industrial operators and end users. 
A Service Request Notification is a request for a service to be performed, such as a maintenance, an inspection, or a return. The notification entry can be made by Asset Administration Shell (AAS), via a service dashboard, service portal or even through the customer service department by phone. 
The Service Request Notification can be considered as a "call for help", which, if the business partner responds to it, triggers the further service process. 
The objective of the Submodel template is to define and standardize the Service Request Notification, including   its content (properties, operations, etc.) and structure. Additionally, service types are defined. 
The objective of this Submodel is to enable the interoperable exchange of these notifications between Asset Administration Shells, and the IT systems of various value creation partners.
