# Carbon Footprint (Version 0.9) 

This is a Submodel template specification for the Asset Adminstration Shell.

## Scope of the Submodel 

This Submodel template provides the means to exchange an asset`s Carbon Footprint (CF) between the 
partners along a value chain. The aim of this Submodel is to increase the interoperability between the 
parties, who are interested in documenting, exchanging, evaluating, or optimizing the environmental footprint 
of their assets. These parties can for example be manufacturers, users/consumers, or logistic partners. The 
CF might be part of larger initiatives such as the Digital Product Passport (DPP) or the Product 
Environmental Footprint. It is not the scope of this Submodel template to substitute the relevant certificates.
Use cases with increasing complexity are described in the following section. The first version of this 
document will focus on Use Case 1 and 2 only. Additional use cases will be supported in future versions.

## About this version

This version is the first version officially published by IDTA

## Difference to prior versions

No prior versions were offically published.

## Status

This version is in productive use and supported by AASX Package Explorer (out of the box)

## Important:
This version is a pre-release. It can and should be used as a common basis for demonstrators, proof-ofconcepts, trainings, etc. It should not be used productively. The upcoming release version v1.0 is 
expected to be different and incompatible to this pre-release. 
This submodel template specification v0.9 is simple to use and contains the major properties relevant for 
communicating a carbon footprint. However, the topic of modelling the environmental footprint is still a 
moving target in the relevant standardisation organizations. A lot has happened since the work on this 
specification has started and the upcoming version v1.0 will reflect the newest developments.
